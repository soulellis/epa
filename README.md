Steve, Harvey and Matt, (2018)

"Steve, Harvey and Matt," by Paul Soulellis, restores access to 1,964 climate change-related assets that were removed from public access at EPA.gov on April 28, 2017. The assets include web page URLs, documents, presentations, publications, and other files that were taken down by U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Scott Pruit under the direction of the Trump administration. While all of the web page now redirect to placeholder "sign posts," many of the hidden files are still live, parked on servers. "Steve, Harvey and Matt," re-publishing the URLs at a rate of ten times each day, is a mix of restored access and empty gestures.
