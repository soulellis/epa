# “Steve, Harvey and Matt,” (2018) by Paul Soulellis

This project — a broadcast, a book, and a download — restores access to 1,964 climate change-related assets that were removed from EPA.gov on April 28, 2017. The assets include web pages, documents, presentations, publications, and other files that were purged by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency under the direction of EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and the Trump administration. Some of the assets had been accessible to the public on the web since 1997. 

The April 28 purge redirected hundreds of removed web pages to one of three new pages: [“This page is being updated,”](https://www.epa.gov/sites/production/files/signpost/cc.html) [“Complying with President Trump's Executive Order on Energy Independence,”](https://www.epa.gov/energy-independence), or the scrubbed [“Energy Resources for State, Local, and Tribal Governments.”](https://www.epa.gov/statelocalenergy#) Many document files (PDFs, PPTs, mp3s, docs) survived the purge and continued to live online, remaining hidden from public view without their corresponding links — until now. “Steve, Harvey and Matt,” broadcasts the entire collection of climate change URLs ten times each day — a mix of restored access and empty gestures. The 734-page printed book contains EPA emails and spreadsheets that detail the purge, obtained by Freedom of Information Act requests.
