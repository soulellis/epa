Subject: Request for time-sensitive website assitance

Steve, Harvey and Matt,

As discussed with Nancy, we would like the content at the links below removed and archived as soon as possible.

The removed climate change pages will be replaced with a custom page that will explain why the change is happening, include a link to the January 19, 2017 snapshot of the EPA website, and a link to the press release weâ€™ll be putting out.

The clean power plan pages will be redirected to the newly posted energy independence pages.

We appreciate your assistance in this time-sensitive matter.

Please let us know if you have questions.

Thank you
